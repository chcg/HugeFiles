Easily view very large files, one chunk at a time.

You can choose.

Any issues, feel free to email me at mjolsonsfca@gmail.com.

## Features ##
1. You can choose to break the chunk up by delimiters ("\r\n" by default, but you can choose any delimiter)
  or just have every chunk be the same size.
2. A nice form for moving between chunks.
